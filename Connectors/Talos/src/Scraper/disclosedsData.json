When drawing the contents of a page and selecting the stroke color from an “ICCBased” colorspace, the application will read a length from the file and use it as a loop sentinel when writing data into the member of an object. Due to the object member being a buffer of a static size allocated on the heap, this can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. A specially crafted document must be loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.",

        "summary": "An exploitable information leak vulnerability exists in the ustream-ssl library of\nOpenWrt, versions 18.06.4 and 15.05.1. When connecting to a remote server, the server’s\nSSL certificate is checked but no action is taken when the certificate is invalid. An\nattacker could exploit this behavior by performing a man-in-the-middle attack, providing\nany certificate, leading to the theft of all the data sent by the client during the first\nrequest.\n### Tested Versions\nOpenWrt 18.06.4, via wget (uclient-fetch)\nOpenWrt 15.05.1, via wget (busybox)\n### Product URLs\nhttps://openwrt.org/\nhttps://git.openwrt.org/project/ustream-ssl.git\n### CVSSv3 Score\n4.0 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N\n### CWE\nCWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n### Details\nOpenWrt is a Linux-based OS, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic.\nOpenWrt is highly customizable, and ships with a set of tools and libraries that have been\noptimized to run on hardware with limited resources.\nAmong these tools, OpenWrt uses wget to allow scripts to download files from the web. In\nOpenWrt 18.06.4, wget is a symbolic link to uclient-fetch, while it’s a symbolic link\nto busybox in OpenWrt 15.05.1. In both cases, the SSL support is provided by the\nustream-ssl library, which is an SSL wrapper for OpenSSL, mbed TLS, and wolfSSL.\nWhen the underlying SSL library used is OpenSSL (package libustream-openssl) or mbed\nTLS (package libustream-mbedtls), ustream-ssl has an issue that could be exploited by\nan attacker to bypass the server’s certificate check and reveal the whole contents of the\nclient’s request.\n### CVE-2019-5101 - OpenSSL (libustream-openssl)\n After an SSL connection is initialized via _ustream_ssl_init, and after any data (e.g.\nthe client’s HTTP request) is written to the stream using ustream_printf, the code\neventually enters the function __ustream_ssl_poll, which is used to dispatch the\nread/write events.\n    static bool __ustream_ssl_poll(struct ustream *s)\n    {\n        struct ustream_ssl *us = container_of(s->next, struct ustream_ssl, stream);\n        char *buf;\n        int len, ret;\n        bool more = false;\n    ustream_ssl_check_conn(us);\n    if (!us->connected || us->error)\n    return false;\n…\n    // [1]\nThe first action taken is to check the SSL connection by calling ustream_ssl_check_conn\nat [1]:\n    static void ustream_ssl_check_conn(struct ustream_ssl *us)\n    {\n        if (us->connected || us->error)\n            return;\n        if (__ustream_ssl_connect(us) == U_SSL_OK) {\n            us->connected = true;\n            if (us->notify_connected)\n                us->notify_connected(us);\n            ustream_write_pending(&us->stream);",

This vulnerability can be triggered from VMware guest and VMware host, which will be affected (leading to vmware-vmx.exe process crash on host).",

When processing a Figure stream from a .jtd, the application will allocate space when parsing a Figure.

If both of these values are larger than the size of the buffer, the application will choose the smaller of the two and trust it to copy data from the file. This value is larger than the buffer size, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
